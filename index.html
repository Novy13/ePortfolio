                        <p class="skills__text" align ="justify">In all honesty, nursing was not in my choice nor did I have any specific courses in mind for after I finished senior high school. It was just when I learned about the course one of my friend planned to take, which is nursing that I start to research about the nursing course. I was attracted to nursing for the reason of practicality, with the salary abroad and such. With the upcoming enrollment of different universities, I had no choice but to apply for the said degree, here in our respected institution.  
                            First few months, I wasn’t able to appreciate the nursing course, as I go on, it gets harder but I just thought to myself that I already invested too much in this, plus the fact that I don’t want to be left behind by my batch mates, I do also want to graduate on time. However, as I go on, I start to see the real beauty of nursing field. I thought to myself, the beauty of this profession is not the high salary but rather the genuine smiles and thank you’s from your patient after you care for them. This realization kept me going for many times now. 
                        Although, I knew to myself that I still a very long way to go to become a competent nurse, my door is very much open for improvements and more experiences that would shape me to become a better me in the near future, not solely for myself  but also for the benefit of my patients. Plus, I believe that nursing career is a continuous learning process.  With a dedication to continuous learning and a genuine desire to contribute to the well-being of patients, I am excited to embark on this journey of becoming a skilled and everlasting nurse.

                <div class="skills__container bd-grid"> 
                    <div class="skills_img">
                        <img id="bless1" src="assets/img/nurse.jpg" alt="">

                    <div>
                        <h2 class="skills__subtitle">Nursing Philosophy Statement</h2>
                        <p class="skills__text" align ="justify">For the past year and a half as a nursing student, I always here the phrase “nursing is an art”. The very first time I heard it, I just laughed it off but as I progressed in nursing school, I start to understand this phrase little by little. This notion has profoundly shaped my understanding of the profession, guiding me to perceive nursing as a dynamic blend of science, empathy, and creativity.

                            The core principle of holistic care, deeply embedded in my philosophy, aligns seamlessly with the artistic nature of nursing. One poignant experience that exemplifies this was; it was our duty in Medicine ward and I was caring for a patient whose physical symptoms improved, yet emotional distress persisted due to lack of family support. He was not from the highlands, he is from Manila so maybe it is also one of the reason why he does not have a watcher and that much visitors. It saddens me that he always tell me about that he’s son is visiting him today but as the time goes on, there is no signs of his son. So aside from taking his V/S and giving him medications, I made sure to stay by his bedside, making him feel that he is not alone. I also tried to engage in conversation with him as often as possible for him to be distracted and not think about his family. This further highlighted the intricate canvas of healthcare, where addressing not only physical ailments but also emotional and social aspects is essential. This realization underscored the artistic intuition required to craft personalized care plans that go beyond standardized protocols.
                            
                            Compassion, another fundamental aspect of my philosophy, takes center stage in the artistry of nursing. During challenging periods when caring for terminally ill patients, the importance of genuine empathy and emotional support became abundantly clear. These experiences reinforced my belief that compassion is not just a skill but an art, requiring an authentic connection with each individual's unique human experience.
                            
                            Evidence-based practice, a scientific cornerstone of nursing, also intertwines with the artistry of adapting interventions based on patient needs. Our clinical instructor had always made an emphasis on this one, that in everything we do it must always be evidence-based. So as a novice nurse, we always make sure to double check everything in our books or in our CI’s before administering or giving medications. 
                            
                            Cultural competence and a commitment to health equity, integral components of my philosophy, find resonance in the artistic palette of nursing. As we all know, Benguet and Baguio consist of a very diverse ethnic groups and also the fact that people from different places or from the lowlands also come to our hospitals here for better treatment. So before interacting with our patients, we always put in our minds that we must always be sensible and sensitive. Engaging with patients from diverse backgrounds has been akin to exploring a rich tapestry of human experiences. These encounters have highlighted the importance of cultural sensitivity and advocacy for fair healthcare practices, contributing to the inclusive and equitable canvas of my nursing approach.
                            
                            Open communication, a vital thread in my philosophy, mirrors the art of dialogue in nursing. As we always include in our FDAR, established rapport. Easy to say and write but very difficult to achieve. I myself, also struggle in establishing rapport easily but I do hope that as I progress, I would be able to master this vital skill. Establishing transparent communication with patients and their families not only builds trust but also fosters collaboration. This collaborative approach, akin to the synergy between an artist and their subject, empowers patients to actively participate in decisions regarding their care.
                            
                            In summary, my nursing philosophy is a harmonious symphony of science and art, where evidence-based practice, compassion, cultural competence, and open communication blend seamlessly to create a canvas of holistic and personalized care. Like an artist refining their masterpiece, my philosophy continues to evolve through experiences, challenges, and a perpetual commitment to the ever-evolving artistry of nursing.

                        <p class="skills__text" align ="justify">As a student, I have so many dreams and aspirations. It is a long and winding road full of obstacles to overcome. However, with proper guidance from our instructors and people around us, I think I would be able to achieve these goals. Similarly to our NCP, I do also have my short and long term goals. 

                            As a student nurse, my dream is just simple, all I want is to pass all my nursing subjects, avoid having 3.0 grade and of course to graduate in time. Kidding aside, my short-term goals revolve around acquiring a solid foundation of clinical skills and medical knowledge. I aim to excel in my coursework, participate actively in clinical experiences, and collaborate effectively within the healthcare team. Developing a proficiency in tasks such as patient assessment, medication administration, and effective communication will be instrumental in laying the groundwork for my future as a competent nurse.
                            Additionally, I intend to actively seek out mentor ship opportunities, engaging with experienced nurses to gain insights into the practical aspects of patient care. By observing and learning from seasoned professionals, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, refining my clinical judgment and decision-making skills.
                            
                            Looking ahead, my long-term goals as a future nurse include successfully passing the boards to attain license and embarking on a fulfilling career as a military nurse. Achieving board certification is a pivotal step in ensuring my competence and adherence to professional standards, providing a solid foundation for my nursing practice.
                            In the military nursing realm, my aspirations involve contributing to the well-being of service members and their families. I aim to bring my nursing skills to diverse and challenging environments, embracing the unique demands of military healthcare. Whether deployed or stationed at home, I hope to play a crucial role in providing compassionate care to those who serve, combining my dedication to nursing with a commitment to the military's mission.
                            Furthermore, I intend to leverage the opportunities within military nursing for continuous learning and professional growth. This includes pursuing specialized training, gaining experience in diverse

                        <p class="skills__text" align ="justify">Embarking on the path of nursing education has been a profound and transformative journey, filled with moments of both challenge and triumph. As a student nurse, my experiences have shaped not only my professional skills but also my understanding of the profound impact that compassionate care can have on individuals in their most vulnerable moments.

                            Reflecting on the year and a half that I spent on nursing school, I would say that I do not have specific work that I would consider my best work so far, but I am very much looking forward to have one as I go on with my nursing career. 
                            On the other hand, I always make sure to give my all to provide every person I come into contact with the greatest treatment possible during our rotations, whether they are in a community, academic, or clinical context. Throughout our RLEs or rotations, I always make sure to stop and consider all the lessons we had learnt in the classroom. It is challenging to maintain a healthy balance between three days of clinical duty and three days back in the classroom. But the thing that makes me feel the most fulfilled when we finish our shift and head home is knowing that I was able to ease my patient's burden in some small way. 
                            Another thing that I would want to consider as one of best work as a student in the near future is the friendship and team that I had form during nursing school. I do believe that being in a right circle while studying is one of the best thing that we should have. Nursing is very tiring and sometimes always requires to have a collaborative effort within your colleagues to finish the task. So having a solid foundation while still in nursing school is very important in the long run. 
                            
                            With that, I just want to share below some pictures that we took together with the best people that I’ve met each time we are done with our duty or RLE.

                            	In a busy medical-surgical unit, I was assigned to care for a patient with complex needs and a history of non-compliance with medications.

                    <p class="skills__text"align ="justify">One of our rotations were the RHU. Our clinical group was assigned on Barangay Bahong. On our three days duty there, we were able to meet different people with different personalities. Our group was tasked to have a house to house visit in the community. I would say that we were overwhelm by their way of accepting us student nurses. Some even offered food and drinks, we also helped some residents with their work while interviewing them and some were happy and even gave us some flowers. Unfortunately, we also encounter some household where they don’t want to entertain us or even close their doors just to avoid us. 
                        In one of our 3 day duty there, it was also there immunization and pre natal check up there, lucky for us, the nurses in their Barangay Health Clinic, allowed us to inject some vaccines and such. All in all our experience there was unforgettable, yes, it is indeed a tiring experience but a memorable one.

Some of our batch mates who were deployed there before us, says that it is boring there and such. However, during our duty there, we had so many patients to the point that we had 78 patients in our first day. Shock was an understatement of what I felt at that moment because it is far from being boring. The following days, fortunately, the number of patients decreased but still, I was exhausted. Our rotation on UHS ended with us feeling tired but heart is so full with all the memories and learning's.
